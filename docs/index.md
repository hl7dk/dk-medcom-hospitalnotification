# MedCom HospitalNotification
This page presents MedComs HospitalNotification standard (Dansk: Sygehusadvis). The standard will in time replace the existing standards called <a href="https://svn.medcom.dk/svn/releases/Standarder/Det%20gode%20kommuneadvis/XDIS17/Dokumentation/XDIS17.pdf" target="_blank">XDIS17</a> &
<a href="https://svn.medcom.dk/svn/releases/Standarder/Det%20gode%20kommuneadvis/XDIS20/Dokumentation/XDIS20.pdf" target="_blank">XDIS20</a>. The purpose of the standard is to notify the municipalities then a citizen in their care is hospitalized, on leave, or discharged. The notification will be sent regardless of the hospitalization of the patient is as an inpatient or acute care. 

The HospitalNotification IG contains the following profiles: 
*	<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-hospitalnotification/StructureDefinition-medcom-hospitalNotification-encounter.html" target="_blank">MedComHospitalNotificationEncounter</a>
*	<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-hospitalnotification/StructureDefinition-medcom-hospitalNotification-message.html" target="_blank">MedComHospitalNotificationMessage</a>
* <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-hospitalnotification/StructureDefinition-medcom-hospitalNotification-messageHeader.html" target="_blank">MedComHospitalNotificationMessageHeader</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>	
Profiles in the HospitalNotification Implementation Guide (IG) will together with profiles from MedCom Core IG, MedCom Messaging IG and MedCom Terminology IG constitute the standard, which you can read more about below.

## 1 Documentation 
The standard documentation below provides the necessary content to understand the needs for modernization, the role of the HospitalNotification message, what to implement and how to get a MedCom certificate. The standard documentation for HospitalNotification includes: 
* Clinical Guidelines
* Use cases
*	Technical Specifications in terms of the relevant IGs and clinical introduction to the content of the IG.
*	An overview of the codes in a FHIR HospitalNotification message which compose a certain meaning
*	Mapping document from <a href="https://svn.medcom.dk/svn/releases/Standarder/Det%20gode%20kommuneadvis/XDIS17/Dokumentation/XDIS17.pdf" target="_blank">XDIS17</a> &
<a href="https://svn.medcom.dk/svn/releases/Standarder/Det%20gode%20kommuneadvis/XDIS20/Dokumentation/XDIS20.pdf" target="_blank">XDIS20</a> to FHIR  HospitalNotification Message.
 
### Clinical Guidelines
The clinical guidelines is the foundation for the HospitalNotification standard. It describes the clinical needs for the modernization, the requirement for the content of the standard and how the standard supports the business requirements.  It is the primary textual part of the documentation for HospitalNotification. It is important for both implementers and business specialists to understand the clinical guidelines to ensure that the implemented standard supports the requirements.

Below can the clinical guidelines in Danish and English be found: 
[Danish: Sundhedsfaglige retningslinjer](assets/documents/Clinical-guidelines-DA.md) <br> 
[English: Clinical guidelines - Work in progress](assets/documents/Clinical-guidelines-ENG.md) 


### Use Cases

Use cases describe the different scenarios a standard support. For a certain real-world scenario, it describes the requirements for the content of a message. The purpose of the use cases is to ensure a coherent implementation and use of the HospitalNotification. The descriptions are targeted IT-system vendors and the people responsible for the implementation in regions and municipalities.

The use cases for HospitalNotification are qualified in collaboration with EPR- and vendors catering to the municipalities.

Below can the use cases in Danish and English be found:

### Technical Specification
The technical specifications for the HospitalNotification standard are defined in IGs. As mentioned previously is the Hospitalnotification standard composed by profiles from three IGs and terminology from one IG. Links to the IGâ€™s are listed below:
*	<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-hospitalnotification/index.html" target="_blank">MedCom HospitalNotification IG</a>
*	<a href="https://medcomdk.github.io/dk-medcom-core/" target="_blank">MedCom Core IG</a>
*	<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-messaging/" target="_blank">MedCom Messaging IG</a>
*	<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-terminology/" target="_blank">MedCom Terminology IG</a>

IGs might be difficult for people with little or no knowledge about FHIR and how to understand an IG. Therefor has MedCom developed a webpage describing the content of the HospitalNotification standard. The link below gives an overview of which profiles are included, what their purpose are, and which elements that shall be supported in a system. Further the structure of the standard is described and supported with examples in different degree of technical skills.



#### Implementation Guide





The IG holds the technical specifications and examples of the MedCom Core profiles. The IG includes profiles, rules, extensions, and examples. Together with profiles from <a href="https://medcomdk.github.io/dk-medcom-core/" target="_blank">MedCom Core IG</a> and <a href="https://medcomdk.github.io/dk-medcom-messaging/" target="_blank">MedCom Messaging IG</a> is a HospitalNotification message composed.

<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-hospitalnotification/" target="_blank">The Implementation Guide for MedCom HospitalNotification.</a>

#### Introduction to the Technical Specifications

The purpose of this section is to give a brief introduction to MedComs HospitalNotification standard to stakeholders with limited knowledge about FHIR. It describes the overall purpose of each profile as well as the composition of the standard. 

[An introduction to the technical specificationscan be found here.](assets/documents/Intro-Technical-Spec-ENG.md)

### HospitalNotification Codes in FHIR

The value of elements in different resources (Encounter, Provenance and Patient) will togther form the composite understanding of a HospitalNotification message. Depended on which activity has taken place, the elements shall be assigned to different values. The receiver (a municipality) of the HospitalNotification can act in accordance to the values.

[The HospitalNotification Codes used in FHIR can be found here.](/assets/documents/Overview-HospitalNotification-codes-FHIR.md)

### Mapping from XDIS17/XDIS20 to MedCom HospitalNotification

Mapping from previous OIOXML standard to FHIR HospitalNotification standard can be found below. The document is intended as a help to translate the previous standard to the new FHIR standard. 
Please notice, that not all elements from XDIS20 and XDIS17 are transfered to the HospitalNotification. However, not all elements from the FHIR elements are represented in the document.

[The mapping can be found here.](/assets/documents/Map_between_OIOXML_and_FHIR_HospitalNotification.md)

## 2 Test and Certification

Certification of a system implies both an approved testprotocol and runtrough of TouchStone testscripts. 
TouchStone describes an infrastructure that allows for automated test and validation against the IGs developes by MedCom.
